To play this game you must move between locations and interact with objects by typing one or two word commands.

To play this game you must collect all the clues in each escape room by playing mini-games.

After you have obtained all the clues, you may guess the password to the escape room to continue to the next room.

To navigate to the mini-games you will need to click on the clue objects placed on the left side of the screen.

There are other action commands in the game. These include:

QUIT: this will quit the game.
PASSWORD <password>: this will allow you to move to the next escape room if you get the password right. Replace <password> with your guess
COMMANDS: this will print the moves that are legal in a given room.
HELP: this will display instructions
INVENTORY: this will print your current inventory.
LOOK: this will print the description for the current room.
VIEW <clue>: this will print the description of a clue in your inventory. Replace <clue> with the name of the clue in your inventory. The clue must be present in your inventory in order to see its description.
ANSWER <answer>: this will allow you to guess the answer to the next mini-game that you are currently on. Replace <answer> with your guess

The game is over when your player escapes all the rooms, or when the timer runs out.
